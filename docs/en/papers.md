<font size=7><div align='center' > The language-centric pretraining mechanism in existing large-scale multimodal models often results in modality bias, making it challenging to capture fine-grained emotional cues. To address this, the Kuaishou Keling team, in collaboration with Nankai University, conducted pioneering research in the field of "multimodal emotion understanding," successfully identifying critical limitations of current multimodal models in detecting emotional signals. The research team introduced a novel modular duplex attention paradigm by focusing on the dimensions of multimodal attention mechanisms. Building on this framework, they developed a multimodal model named MODA, which integrates capabilities in perception, cognition, and emotion understanding. MODA demonstrated substantial performance improvements across 21 benchmark tests spanning six major task categories: general QA, knowledge QA, table & ocr, visual-centric, cognitive analysis, and emotion understanding. Additionally, thanks to the innovative attention mechanism, MODA excelled in human-computer interaction scenarios such as character profiling and planning deduction. This groundbreaking work has been accepted by ICML 2025 and selected as a **Spotlight Paper (Top 2.6%)**. ✨ </div></font>

<font size=7><div align='center' > When labels are extremely scarce, there is an urgent need to explore a low-cost, annotation-free large-scale supervision signal. To address this, a masked emotion modeling method is proposed, which leverages linguistic emotional cues from videos to reconstruct the temporal distribution of emotions for learning discriminative representations. ✨ </div></font>
